# First Phoenix Attempt
First Elixir-newbie attempt at a Phoenix application following a tutorial : 
https://graffino.com/web-development/first-steps-in-elixir-and-phoenix-create-a-blog-prototype

As this tutorial was created in September 2020, there were quite a number of changes required to work with the newer Phoenix and Elixir versions.
Took some time to figure out what's what, what changes and how to so that it built without errors - got there eventually. :)

This buildable version works with Phoenix 1.7.12 and Elixir 1.17.1.
As this was all done inside a docker container, the db(dockered Postgres too) connection strings have been removed.
Not tested outside a container.
